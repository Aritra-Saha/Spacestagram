# Spacestagram

Spacestagram is an Instagram clone that leverages NASA's APOD API and allows users to see astronomy related pictures in an instagram post format. The website returns 15 randomly selected space-related posts with a title, date, description and option to like/unlike each photo. The state of the website is maintained over each session (reloading or duplicating a tab will maintain the same posts and whether a post is liked or unliked). However, if you open a new tab of the site then you will get an entirely new set of posts.
